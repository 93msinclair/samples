# Square-root Sample

This sample includes a square-root calculator.

For additional information on this sample, read the
[Application Model](http://pedestal.io/documentation/application-model/) 
documentation. There are comments at the end of `square_root.clj` that 
walk through using the sample inside a repl.

## Getting Started

* Start the repl with `lein repl`.
* Use the `io.pedestal.app` and `square-root` namespaces:

```clojure
(use 'io.pedestal.app)
(use 'square-root)
```

* Walk through the code at the end of `square_root.clj`
