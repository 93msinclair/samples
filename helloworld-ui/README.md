# helloworld-ui

This sample code is the result of running:

```bash
lein new pedestal-app helloworld-ui
```

You may start the application by running `lein repl`, then entering `(run)` at the prompt.

It is intended to work alongside the documentation here:

[Hello World Client App](https://github.com/relevance/platform/wiki/Hello-World-Client-App)

Please read this wiki page as well as looking at the code here.
